# Proxy Scanner and Scraper

A program that:
 - Scans proxies determining their performance (latency), type (HTTP or SOCKS), anonymity level (L1-L3)
 - Scrapes proxies off a given URL list
 - Harvests URLs using the BING search engine based on date (optional) for the most recent proxies

## July, 2020 Update
Seems like the first proxy judge 'http://proxyjudge.info/azenv.php' is flagging 99% of good proxies as 'bad', would HIGHLY recommend using other proxy judges by selecting a different one from the dropdown-list/combo-list in the Scanner tab. 

## 2021 Update
Disclaimer: After 3-4 years, URL Harvester will not work anymore (data is no longer contained solely as HTML in BING) unless re-implemented from scratch (ex: with a headless browser). Scraper should still work if provided with a list of URLs as does the Scanner still work :)
